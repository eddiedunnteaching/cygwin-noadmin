# Install cygwin with packages and without admin on windows

This is a simple way to install and update a non-admin cygwin installation.

NOTE: If you would like to install `wget` as many of the tutorials tell you as a non-admin you will run into issues with `libusb0` as it requires a driver install that a non-admin cannot perform. You can just "skip" the package install and it will work but I thought it more simple to just use `curl` instead.
